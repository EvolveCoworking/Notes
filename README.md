# Foundational Principles (A work in progress)

I. A Safe Space

    - Video Surveilance/Recording on interior of space

    - Smart Lock on Door, for 24-hour access.

    - Deadbolt on bathroom.

    - Pay as you go phone on charger in bathroom, for emergency calling.
    
II. Respect the Needs of the Other Members

    - Code of Conduct, must be signed by all members and visitors.

III. A Self-Managing Space

IV. Freedom Within the Structure
    
    - Well-behaved dogs are welcome.
    
V. Start Minimally, Add Only What's Truly Needed
    
    - What's needed: based on evidence and experimentation rather than guesswork
