### An Experimental, Self-Managed, Shared Work Space

# Foundational Principles (A work in progress)

I. A Safe Space

- Video Surveilance/Recording for interior.

- Smart Lock on Door, for 24-hour access.

- Deadbolt on bathroom.

- Pay as you go phone on charger in bathroom, for emergency calling.

II. Respect the Needs of the Other Members

- Code of Conduct must be signed by all members and visitors.

- Phone calls or loud conversations must be taken onto the balcony.

- If someone is wearing headphones, assume they are trying to concentrate.

- If you are doing anything that would potentially disrupt the
  Internet service, you must use a VPN.

III. A Self-Managing Space

- Membership requires auto-payment.

- Leave the space better than you found it.

IV. Freedom Within the Structure

- Well-behaved dogs are welcome.

- Bring your own cooler and coffee mug.

V. Start Minimally, Add Only What's Truly Needed

- What's needed: based on evidence and experimentation, not guesswork and assumptions.

- New ideas and additions should be as automated as possible and must not add to the workload of any particular member.
